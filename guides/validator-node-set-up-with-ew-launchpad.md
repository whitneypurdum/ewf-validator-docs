# Validator node set-up with EW Launchpad

Validators who opt to install and run their nodes externally can use [**Launchpad by Energy Web**](https://launchpad.energyweb.org/login) to install and host their Validator Nodes. This presents major advantages as the platform will fully support your node and handle the technical requirements. Additionally, spinning up your nodes using Launchpad is a lot quicker and does not require heavy technical knowledge.

Energy Web members still benefit from 1 EWC and 1 Volta node even when using Launchpad.

There is the option to chose to bring your own cloud (BYOC) or to use a managed cloud.
