# EWC Validator Documentation Overview

Welcome to the homepage for Energy Web Chain validator technical documentation!&#x20;

This space is organized into two primary groups:

* [Installing a validator node](guides/installing-a-validator-node/): Start here if you are new to the EWC validator community and setting up a node for the first time.&#x20;
* [Maintaining a validator node](guides/maintaining-a-validator-node/): Here you will find step-by-step instructions for a variety of operational and maintenance tasks.&#x20;

If you need further information or troubleshooting assistance, please use the dedicated [Validator Knowledge Base](https://discuss.energyweb.org/c/knowledge-base/15).&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** Validators can[^1] opt to outsource their node installation and operation to third-party service providers.&#x20;



Validators who opt to install and run their nodes externally can use [**Launchpad by Energy Web**](https://launchpad.energyweb.org/login) to install and host their Validator Nodes. Find detailed instructions in our [Quick Start Guide](https://docs-launchpad.energyweb.org/launchpad-by-energy-web/blockchain-infrastructure/validator-nodes/quick-start-guide).
