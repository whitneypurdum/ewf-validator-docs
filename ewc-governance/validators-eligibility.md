# Validators eligibility

At the time of the launch of the EWC in June 2019, the initial cohort of 10 Validators (all of whom were founding EWF Affiliates) decided that organizations must meet the following criteria to be eligible to become EWC Validators:

1. Be **legally registered organizations** (not individuals);
2. Be an **official Member of EWF** (i.e. have an active Membership in good standing), and;
3. Demonstrate **technical and security competence**

In February 2020, the Validators asked for greater transparency and a formal structure for the EW membership program. The primary objective is to ensure that all members have sufficient reputation (i.e. good standing) and operational capabilities to strengthen the EW Chain and EW-DOS utility layer. Based on this feedback, the eligibility criteria for EW Membership was updated as follows:&#x20;

To be eligible for EW Membership, organizations must:

1. **Have legitimate operational activities that will contribute to the mission of EWF and the success of the EW Chain**; this includes energy market participants (e.g. grid/market operators, utilities/retailers, aggregators), organizations who provide products and services to energy market participants (e.g. OEMs/technology providers, regulatory/research organizations, financial services), and organizations who actively contribute to the development of open-source technology that enhances the Energy Web Decentralized Operating System. \

2. **Have sufficient reputation (or “authority”) to credibly strengthen the Proof-of-Authority consensus mechanism** (i.e. must have a minimum of three customer/project references that demonstrate the nature of the operational activities described above).
